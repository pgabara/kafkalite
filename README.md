# kafkalite

**kafkalite** is a minimal, educational implementation of a Kafka-style message broker, written in Rust.
It's designed to help you (and me!) understand how Kafka works internally â€” while getting hands-on experience with async Rust.

> **Note:** This project is for learning purposes only and is **not** intended for production use.

## Goals
- Learn core concepts behind Apache Kafka (topics, partitions, brokers, producers/consumers)
- Practice writing idiomatic Rust with `async`/`await`
- Explore distributed systems fundamentals in a small, approachable codebase

## Non-goals
- Full Kafka protocol compatibility
- High throughput or fault tolerance (this is a playground!)
